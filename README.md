# Mayori-Overlay

Mayori's Gentoo test overlay for some personal stuff.

Experimental changes to several ebuild from official gentoo repo.

I'm running Gentoo with `musl libc` . If you are not using musl, be careful about some patches in this repo named as `musl-compat` , which may not compile on non-musl systems.

## Package Notes:
